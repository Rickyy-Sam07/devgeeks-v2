## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Images not loading?**
A: Make sure dev server is restarted (`npm run dev`)

**Q: Images look different?**
A: WebP quality is set to 80, which is optimal. Should look identical.

**Q: Browser compatibility?**
A: WebP is supported by 96% of browsers. Next.js handles fallbacks automatically.

**Q: Want to use AVIF instead?**
A: Just change `.webp` to `.avif` in the components. AVIF files are even smaller!
